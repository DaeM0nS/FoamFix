This is a kind of "Last Hurrah" update. It is strongly recommended.

* Improved the performance of the model data deduplication step.
* Slightly improved the memory usage of smallPropertyValue-created BlockStates.
* Incorporated minor memory usage optimization ideas from malte0811's FerriteCore (with permission) - these have a much bigger impact on 1.14+, but they also won't hurt in 1.12.2.
* Fixed a memory leak issue with Railcraft tanks (#271).
* Minor code improvements; they may help fix some issues, but no promises.
